This is a project, to combine Webpack, ES6 and Angular 1.x.
The intention us to apply modern hmr, and ES6 under my loved Angular 1.x

First :
```bash
npm i
```
For Dev, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This create once compiled js, and then start de hmr server of webpack.

To use angular-sanitize, you must import the index, it was made for commonjs.
